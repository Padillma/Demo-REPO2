## Demo 2

this is a second repo in order to show a repo can be made locally.

when completely brand new use this on the command line "git init".
this will make it a git repo and to comfirm this, check with "git status".
if it worked, your files will be in red and would have to use the git add line.

i then commit with "git commit -m "tutor.second" -m "demo-repo-sequel""

## subheader

this will be my second commit
i found problems pushing to github had to use gitbash. powershell terminal was not using the correct key even tho on gitbash i was already connected.
